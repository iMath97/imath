                <p>This script can be used to make backups of almost everything such as your music collection, your photos, important files that you update on a regular basis or even gamesaves.</p>
                <p>Today I will show you how to write this script and use it for a Minecraft world.</p>

                    <p>First you need to make a simple text document in a program you like such as Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime text or even something else. I will be using Sublime text.</p>
                    <p>Then you have to save it as a .bat file (see picture).</p>

                    <p><b>Line 1:</b> this will hide the commands in the cmd (not necessary).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Line 2:</b> this will set the output color in the cmd to green (not necessary).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Line 3:</b> this will set the title of your cmd (not necessary).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Line 4 and 5:</b> this creates a variable called 'name' and stores the Minecraft world name and the current date. Change 'WORLDNAME' to the name of your Minecraft world.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Line 6:</b> this will copy the world files to your destination. You need to copy this path. Change 'USERNAME' to your computer username. Change '4ever' to the name of your world. The second path is your destination. You can change this to whatever you like. You just have to keep '\%name%' on the end of the path. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Line 7:</b> this will add a pause on the end of the script so you can see the result.</p>
