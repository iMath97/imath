                    <p>iMath.tech is a blog about technology where you can find projects I worked on or I'm working on right now. I also have some guides for you. You can play games here written in javascript or in unity. There are also javascript programs where I do some visual or functional experimentation. More detailed info can be found <a href="/info/generalinfo">here</a>.</p>
