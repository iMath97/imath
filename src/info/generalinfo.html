                    <p>My name is Mathias Camus and I am what you would call a "nerd". I build websites, computers, scripts and I solve problems, or at least I try to solve them. I was born with a disablity and I want to show that being disabled isn't something that will hold you back if you're really passionate about something.</p>

                    <p>You can find tutorials about lots of things, for example making a great looking desktop like I did in the picture below. You can also find scripts or little programs coded by me that could make your life easier. For example a script that can make automatic backups of files you regularly update.</p>

                    <p>You can also keep track of my projects that I have worked on or that I'm working on at the moment. For example automating with Google home or with IFTTT. I'm also planning on making a smart mirror.</p>
